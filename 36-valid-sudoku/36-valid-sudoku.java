// Collect the set of things we see, encoded as strings. For example:

// '4' in row 7 is encoded as "(4)7".
// '4' in column 7 is encoded as "7(4)".
// '4' in the top-right block is encoded as "0(4)2".
// Scream false if we ever fail to add something because it was already added (i.e., seen before).
